# New Jersey School Performance Data and Taxpayers Guide to Education Spending Analysis

### Purpose
New Jersey provides multiple sets of public data on school systems to enable comparisons and informed decisions regarding school performance and spending. This analysis leverages two primary resources:

- **Taxpayers Guide to Education Spending**: [https://www.nj.gov/education/guide/](https://www.nj.gov/education/guide/)
- **New Jersey School Performance Report**: [https://rc.doe.state.nj.us/](https://rc.doe.state.nj.us/)

Various ranking systems use different metrics to rank schools within a particular area. This analysis focuses on comparing similar districts by DFG and Group across the state, using metrics such as:
- **Cost per pupil**
- **Test Results in ELA/Math**
- **Chronic Absentee Rates**

The goal is to facilitate fairer comparisons by focusing on "similar" schools. Two main criteria are used to classify and compare districts:

1. **District Factor Groups (DFG)**: A demographic classification system for New Jersey school districts:
   - A (Abbott Districts)
   - B
   - CD
   - DE
   - FG
   - GH
   - I
   - J (Very affluent districts)

2. **School Size/Type**: Based on grade level and student population:
   - A. K-6
   - B. K-8 / 0 - 400 students
   - C. K-8 / 401 - 750 students
   - D. K-8 / 751+ students
   - E. K-12 / 0 - 1800 students
   - F. K-12 / 1801 - 3500 students
   - G. K-12 / 3501+ students
   - H. 7-12 / 9-12
   - I. CSSD
   - J. VOC

### Analysis Output
This analysis provides multiple comparative views, including:

1. Schools in the **same county and group**
2. Schools in the **same county, group, and DFG**
3. Schools in the **same county**
4. Schools in the **same group and DFG + 1** (next higher district factor group)
5. Schools in **any other DFGs within the same group**
6. Schools in **any other counties within the same group**

For each comparison, the following metrics are displayed:

1. **ELA Scores** (by year)
2. **Math Scores** (by year)
3. **ELA Scores by year by graduation year (cohort)**
4. **Math Scores by year by graduation year (cohort)**
5. **Pupils per Administrator**
6. **Pupils per Staff** (Note: this is not classroom size)
7. **Per Pupil Cost**
8. **Staff Mean Salary**
